# Animelist Discord Bot

Animelist is a Discord bot that allows users to search for Anime, Manga, Users and Characters on Anilist. It is designed to be used in a sentence or by themselves altogether.

# Getting Started

To use this bot, you will need to create a config.json file in the root directory of the project with the following fields:

{
"token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
"maxLength": 300
}

You can replace the maxLength with any value you want. This configures the length of the message that the bot will send.
